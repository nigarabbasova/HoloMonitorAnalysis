# HoloMonitorAnalysis - rescaling procedure 
In this notebook, we are trying to rescale intensity values in images obtained using HoloMonitor to obtain physical values for the optical thickness of the cells. 

To run the notebook, create the following directory path: "HoloMonitor Beta TIFF/September 2023/MDCK Edna_06.09.23-B1-1_100ul" with images of MDCK cells. You can of course use any images that you would like - just make sure to adjust the directory path for the images.
